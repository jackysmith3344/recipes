Frumenty (or fermitty) 
A traditional recipe that used spare wheat seeds after the spring sowing, updated for a modern kitchen.  I eat it as a wonderfully filling and delicious breakfast - a real treat when the weather's cold.

Per portion:
A handful of wheat grain – the food hub's spelt grain is perfect
A small quantity of milk
A few sultanas or similar 

In the evening, pick over the grain to take out any that still have husks.  Put the grain in a thermos flask and fill the flask with boiling water.  Seal the flask.
In the morning, empty the flask into a sieve and put the wheat in a saucepan.  Add enough milk to not quite cover the grain and the dried fruit.
Simmer for about 10 minutes until the porridge is thick, stirring occasionally.  

You can use a slow cooker or the slow oven of a rayburn if you have one.  Make sure there's plenty of water with the wheat while you're soaking it – it absorbs more water than you'd think possible  and the porridge cooks better if the grain is well soaked first.
You can add a small spoonful of honey instead of the dried fruit; or a few slices of banana.  Add these when the porridge is cooked rather than while it's cooking.
